# Welcome to our project ðŸ˜„
### This file should contain all the information you should need before starting work with us
___
We have setup a simple workflow yml file that runs whenever you push or makes a pull request. This will build the code in gradle and see if it is able to run it as a test

**Make sure that under build.gradle (project) that your plugins are using version 7.4.1 and not 8.0.0 as this has caused us issues before**
